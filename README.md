A Proactive and Specialized AI for Automated Security Patching

The AI Code Guardian is a specialized monitoring and alignment system designed to work with a bug-fixing AI agent. Moving beyond general-purpose monitoring, this project focuses on the high-stakes task of automated security vulnerability patching. It ensures that the bug-fixing agent's actions are secure, correct, and aligned with project goals from the very first step.
Why The AI Code Guardian?

The rise of autonomous AI agents for code writing presents a significant challenge: how do we prevent them from "going rogue" or introducing subtle errors? In the domain of security, a single mistake can have major consequences. This project provides a robust solution by implementing a proactive, human-in-the-loop guardian that acts as a real-time safety net for every decision the bug-fixing agent makes.
How It Works: Proactive Alignment in Action

The system operates on a closed-loop feedback mechanism with three core components
 * The Bug-Fixing Agent: The primary LLM (e.g., a fine-tuned model for code) tasked with identifying and patching security vulnerabilities
 * The Guardian Agent: A secondary, highly specialized LLM service that acts as the "sentinel." Before the bug-fixing agent begins, the Guardian Agent analyzes the vulnerability and the relevant codebase to generate a detailed, aligned plan. It then injects this plan directly into the bug-fixing agent's initial prompt, guiding its reasoning from the start.
 * The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server: The central hub that manages communication. It logs every action, provides a real-time visualization of the agent's progress, and surfaces a user interface for human validation when the Guardian Agent detects a potential issue.

Key Innovations
* Proactive Guidance: The Guardian Agent doesn't wait for a mistake. It provides a pre-flight plan to prevent misalignment before it can occur.
* Specialized Focus: By narrowing the scope to security vulnerabilities, the system can apply a more precise and effective set of rules and heuristics.
* Continuous Learning: Approved human corrections and rejected interventions are logged and used to fine-tune the Guardian Agent, creating a system that gets smarter and more aligned over time.
* Human-in-the-Loop: For critical decisions, a human operator is prompted to review and validate the agent's proposed changes, providing a crucial layer of oversight and control.
